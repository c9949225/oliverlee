<H1>The Eclipse Test Framework</H1>
<P>Last Modified: June 13, 2007</P>
<P><FONT size=+1><BR>Introduction</FONT></P>
<P>The testing framework is comprised of the org.eclipse.test plugin and the 
org.eclipse.ant.optional.junit fragment. </P>
<P>These two projects are available from the dev.eclipse.org repository and are 
included in the eclipse-test-framework-&lt;buildId&gt;.zip from the eclipse.org 
downloads page.</P>
<P><FONT size=+1>Building and Installation</FONT></P>
<P>Since the org.eclipse.test plugin is stored in the repository in source-code 
form, it needs to be compiled before it can be used. The 
org.eclipse.ant.optional.junit fragment does not contain any source and can be 
used as is from the repository.</P>
<OL>
  <LI>Turn of automatic builds. Window-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Workbench and uncheck 
  "Perform build automatically on resource modification"
  <LI>Load org.eclipse.test into your workspace.
  <LI>Right-click on the org.eclipse.test project in either the Navigator or 
  Packages view. Select 'Rebuild Project' from the context menu. This will 
  compile the entire org.eclipse.test plugin.
  <LI>Finally, copy the org.eclipse.test plugin into your target Eclipse. 
  <LI>The org.eclipse.ant.optional.junit fragment only needs to be present in 
  the environment of the Eclipse that is overseeing the test process. If you are 
  running the test script from within the Workbench, this means that the 
  fragments need to be present withinn your development Eclipse. If you are 
  running the tests from the command line, then the fragments will need to be 
  present in your target Eclipse.</LI></OL>
<P><FONT size=+1>Setup</FONT></P>
<P>Follow the steps given above to build and install all of the neccessary 
plugins and fragments. Please note that the current version of the test 
framework is not compatible with the PDE notion of self-hosting. If you want to 
run the tests, you will need to setup a full target Eclipse so that the testing 
framework can detect everything that is needed.</P>
<P>If you are writing tests for one or more Eclipse plugins, then you should 
create a separate plugin for tests. The test plugin will contain all of the 
tests that will be run on your development plugins, as well as defining how 
those tests get run.</P>
<P>If you are not writing tests for an Eclipse plugin, then you should look into 
using JUnit on its own to test your work. JUnit is designed for testing Java 
code, and by default has no knowledge of Eclipse. There are separate mechanisms 
for using JUnit on Java code in Eclipse. See the documentation provided 
here:</P>

Support in Eclipse</A><BR><A 
href="http://dev.eclipse.org:8080/help/content/help:/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/tasks/tasks-207.htm?resultof=%6a%75%6e%69%74%20&amp;toc=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.user%2Ftoc.xml">Using 
JUnit</A></P>
<P>Once a test plugin has been created, you must then create an Ant script that 
will run all of the tests. Create a file called 'test.xml' in the root of your 
plug-in or bundle. This is an Ant file that defines how each test is going to be 
run. The 'test.xml' file is like a DOS batch file that scripts the entire 
testing process. Typically, the 'test.xml' file will contain targets for setting 
up the test run, executing the tests, cleaning up afterwards, and running the 
entire process.</P>
<P><FONT size=+1>Converting existing Test Suites</FONT></P>
<P>If you are converting an existing set of tests to use the new framework, the 
actual tests that have been written should not need much change.</P>
<P>If you have tests in multiple plugins, move these to a single test plug-in 
for your component.</P>
<P>Make sure that the tests are defined in a plug-in. This is probably the most 
common cause of confusion in the entire test process. Your tests need to be in a 
plug-in so that Eclipse can find them when it tries to load them.</P>
<P><FONT size=+1>Creating new Test Suites</FONT></P>
<P>Creating new JUnit tests for an Eclipse plugin should be no more difficult 
than writing standard JUnit tests. Since the framework allows tests to be run 
inside of a working Eclipse, any tests that you write have available to them any 
of the methods supplied by the Eclipse platform, provided that you add the 
appropriate dependencies to your tests' manifest.</P>
<P><FONT size=+1>Performance Issues</FONT></P>
<P>You should keep in mind the number of times that Eclipse needs to be started. 
Launching Eclipse has a substantial cost in terms of runtime. To minimize the 
number of times the platform is started, you should consider writing a TestSuite 
called AllTests for each of your test plugins. AllTests should invoke each of 
the tests that you want to run for a particular plugin. The 'test.xml' file can 
then run the AllTests class, which will run all of your tests, but the platform 
will only ever be started once for each of your test plugins.</P>
<P>Note: Sometimes tests involve shutting down, restarting, and testing the 
state of metadata that was written to disk. These session tests will require 
Eclipse to be launched several times in sequence, which will increase the 
runtime of your tests. This cannot be avoided.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT size=+1>Running the Test Suite from the UI</FONT></P>
<P>Right click on the test.xml file and select 'Run Ant...' from the pull-down 
menu. The Running Ant dialog box pops up. From the list of targets, select the 
one that runs all of your tests. If you are using the example file provided 
below, this target is called 'Run', and will be selected by default. Hit the 
'Finish' button to start the test process.</P>
<P><FONT size=+1>Running the Test Suite from the command line</FONT></P>
<P>When the test suites are invoked automatically, they are run from command 
line. From the ${eclipse-home} directory, the command to use is:</P><CODE>java 
-jar plugins\org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_&lt;version&gt;.jar -application 
org.eclipse.ant.core.antRunner -buildfile ${test-plugin-path}\test.xml 
-Declipse-home=${eclipse-home} -Dos=&lt;operating system&gt; -Dws=&lt;windowing 
system&gt; -Darch=&lt;architecture&gt;</CODE> 
<P>Individual tests can also be invoked directly. From the ${eclipse-home} 
directory, use the command:</P><CODE>java -jar 
plugins\org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_&lt;version&gt;.jar -application 
${launcher} -os &lt;operating system&gt; -ws &lt;windowing system&gt; -arch 
&lt;architecture&gt; -dev bin -testpluginname ${plugin-name} -classname 
${test-classname} 
formattter=org.apache.tools.ant.taskdefs.optional.junit.XMLJUnitResultFormatter,&lt;path 
to output file with .xml extension&gt;</CODE> 
<P>where ${launcher} is one of: <I>org.eclipse.test.uitestapplication</I> or 
<I>org.eclipse.test.coretestapplication</I> depending on whether or not you want 
to run your tests within an active Workbench.</P>
<P><FONT size=+1>Output</FONT></P>
<P>By default, output from each test run is logged as XML. For each test that is 
run, the output is logged into the file called ${classname}.xml. The individual 
XML files are located in the ${eclipse-home} directory. When the test run is 
finished, you can call the <B>"collect"</B> target in the library file, which 
will collect the XML into a single file. See below for an example of how to use 
this target correctly.</P>
<H3>Other issues</H3>
<H4>Headless Testing vs. UI testing</H4>
<P>Many plugin tests will not need the Workbench active in order to run. Indeed, 
only the minimum number of plugins needed to run the plugin being tested need to 
be present when testing in a target Eclipse. There are two different Ant targets 
provided for running Eclipse plugin tests. One target starts the entire 
Workbench. The other starts Eclipse with the minimum number of plugins needed. 
It is up to you to decide which target is most appropriate. For examples, look 
at the <B>"ui-test"</B> and <B>"core-test"</B> targets below.</P>
<H4>Disposing the Display</H4>
<P>Some low-level tests for the Eclipse platform take actions that are not 
normally possible inside of Eclipse. An example of this behaviour would be 
disposing the display. While this action can be performed while running the UI, 
it will also kill the UI for the copy of Eclipse that is running, and cause 
errors when the Workbench tries to shutdown. If you need to test disposing the 
display, or other similar actions, your tests should be running without a UI. 
</P>
<H4>Tests that are not plugins</H4>
<P>It is very easy to forget to define your tests inside of a plugin. If your 
tests will not load properly, make sure that a plug-in manifest exists in your 
test project, and also that the plugin is being loaded by the platform. Make 
sure that all of the dependencies are satisfied for your test plugin.</P>
<P><FONT size=+1>Interface</FONT></P>
<P>The org.eclipse.test plugin defines many useful Ant tasks/targets to aid 
developers in writing their test.xml scripts. Currently, there is only Ant 
targets defined, which can be called using Ant's built-in &lt;ant&gt; task. To 
use these targets, add the following line to the top of your script, and 
reference the ${library-file} property when calling 
&lt;ant&gt;:</P><CODE>&lt;property name="library-file" 
value="${eclipse-home}/fragments/org.eclipse.test/library.xml"/&gt; </CODE>
<P>The targets that are defined are: </P>
<UL>
  <LI><B>ui-test</B> - This target runs a JUnit test suite inside of an Eclipse 
  Workbench. This target is mainly for testing plugins that use the Eclipse UI 
  and JFace. The output of the test pass is automatically logged in an XML file 
  called ${classname}.xml. It takes four arguments: 
  <UL>
    <LI><I>data-dir</I> - The data directory of the Eclipse that gets run
    <LI><I>plugin-name</I> - The name of the plugin that the test suite is 
    defined in
    <LI><I>classname</I> - The name of the class that the test suite is defined 
    in
    <LI><I>vmargs</I> - An optional argument string to pass to the VM running 
    the tests</LI></UL>
  <P>For example, the following code will run the test 
  org.eclipse.foo.bar.MyTest in the plugin org.eclipse.foo in a new Eclipse 
  workbench. It passes the string "-Dbaz=true" to the VM. The Eclipse stores its 
  metadata in the directory "data-folder". <CODE><PRE>&lt;ant target="ui-test" antfile="${library-file}" dir="${eclipse-home}"&gt;
  &lt;property name="data-dir" value="data-folder"/&gt;
  &lt;property name="plugin-name" value="org.eclipse.foo"/&gt;
  &lt;property name="classname" value="org.eclipse.foo.bar.MyTest"/&gt;
  &lt;property name="vmargs" value="-Dbaz=true"/&gt;
&lt;/ant&gt;
</PRE></CODE>
  <LI><B>core-test</B> - This target runs a JUnit test suite inside of an 
  IPlatformRunnable. This target is for testing plugins that use the Eclipse 
  platform, but do not require a UI to be running. The output of the test pass 
  is automatically logged in an XML file called ${classname}.xml. It takes four 
  arguments: 
  <UL>
    <LI><I>data-dir</I> - The data directory of the Eclipse that gets run
    <LI><I>plugin-name</I> - The name of the plugin that the test suite is 
    defined in
    <LI><I>classname</I> - The name of the class that the test suite is defined 
    in
    <LI><I>vmargs</I> - An optional argument string to pass to the VM running 
    the tests</LI></UL>
  <P>For example, the following code will run the test 
  org.eclipse.foo.bar.MyTest in the plugin org.eclipse.foo in a headless 
  Eclipse. It passes the string "-Dbaz=true" to the VM. The Eclipse stores its 
  metadata in the directory "data-folder". <CODE><PRE>&lt;ant target="core-test" antfile="${library-file}" dir="${eclipse-home}"&gt;
  &lt;property name="data-dir" value="data-folder"/&gt;
  &lt;property name="plugin-name" value="org.eclipse.foo"/&gt;
  &lt;property name="classname" value="org.eclipse.foo.bar.MyTest"/&gt;
  &lt;property name="vmargs" value="-Dbaz=true"/&gt;
&lt;/ant&gt;
</PRE></CODE>
  <LI><B>collect</B> - This target collects the XML files that are produced over 
  the course of the test script. It takes two arguments: 
  <UL>
    <LI><I>includes</I> - A pattern matching all XML files to be included in the 
    test report. This argument is typically "org*.xml"
    <LI><I>output-file</I> - The filename where the output of the test gets 
    stored. For the automated build process, this file should be 
    ${pluginname}.xml, and be located in the ECLIPSE_HOME directory.</LI></UL>
  <P>For example, the following code collects all of the files matching the 
  pattern "org*.xml" in the directory ${eclipse-home}, into the file named 
  "logfile.xml". <CODE><PRE>&lt;ant target="collect" antfile="${library-file}" dir="${eclipse-home}"&gt;
  &lt;property name="includes" value="org*.xml"/&gt;
  &lt;property name="output-file" value="logfile.xml"/&gt;
&lt;/ant&gt;
</PRE></CODE></LI></UL>
<H2>Examples:</H2>
<P>Included is the 'test.xml' file from the org.eclipse.jdt.ui.tests.refactoring 
plugin. This file controls all of the automated testing that is done for the 
org.eclipse.jdt.ui.tests.refactoring plugin. It can be run from inside of 
Eclipse or from the command line. It is intended to serve as a template file for 
testing any other plugin.</P>
<P>Notice that the structure of the file roughly mirrors that of a JUnit test. 
Targets are defined for setting up the tests, defining what needs to be done, 
cleaning up after the tests, and running everything in the right 
order.</P><CODE><PRE>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;

<H2>Known Issues:</H2>
<H4>Problem 1: Issues with Ant 1.3</H4>
<P>Ant 1.3 has some issues when used with the &lt;style&gt; tag and absolute 
paths. Also, any tests that use the <CODE>System.exit()</CODE> call will not log 
their output properly when using Ant 1.3.</P>
<H4>Problem 2: ECLIPSE_HOME</H4>
<P>The test suites need to know where the root of the eclipse install is on the 
file system (the ECLIPSE_HOME variable). However, this variable is only defined 
in JDT. The ${eclipse-home} property can be set to a reasonable default inside 
of the test.xml script. Then tests can be run from the standard Ant window, 
without having to specify -Declipse-home=%ECLIPSE_HOME%. If a value for 
${eclipse-home} does get passed in, the default (specified in test.xml) gets 
overridden. The parameter is passed in by the build mechanism. For most cases, 
the value "${basedir}/../.." is a reasonable default.</P>
<H4>Problem 3: Ugly reference to library.xml</H4>
<P>org.eclipse.test should provide Ant tasks, not template scripts.</P>
<H4>Problem 4: No console output</H4>
<P>When you run a TestSuite using the standard JUnit, it normally outputs a 
series of dots to the console so that you can track the TestSuite's progress. It 
is not possible to add this feature to the automated testing process at this 
point in time.</P>
<H4>Problem 5: Ant java task on Linux</H4>
<P>Ant expects there to be a java executable on the system path. Furthermore, 
the executable must be a real file, not a symbolic link. If the test framework 
is throwing an exception <CODE>java.io.IOException: java: not found</CODE>, 
ensure that the java executable is on your system path.</P>
<H4>Problem 6: PDE</H4>
<P>The testing framework currently has no knowledge of PDE. In order to run the 
automated you must be running a self hosting environment with a full development 
and target Eclipse.</P></BODY></HTML>
