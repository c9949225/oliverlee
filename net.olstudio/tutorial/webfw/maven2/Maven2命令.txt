		       -DartifactId=simple
		       -DpackageName=com.sonatype.maven

mvn is the Maven 2 command. 

archetype:create is called a Maven goal. If you are familiar with Apache Ant, a
Maven goal is analogous to an Ant target; both describe a unit of work to be completed in a build.

-Dname=value pairs are arguments that are passed to the goal and take the form of -D properties,

注:A Maven Plugin is a collection of one or more goals.
Jar plugin which contains goals for creating JAR files, 
Compiler plugin which contains goals for compiling source code and unit tests 
Surefire plugin which contains goals for executing unit tests and generating
reports.

注:When referring to a plugin goal, we frequently use the shorthand notation: pluginId:goalId. For
example, when referring to the create plugin in the Archetype plugin, we write archetype:create.

***************************************************************************************
注:Plugin goals can be attached to a lifecycle phase. As Maven moves through the phases in a lifecycle, it will
execute the goals attached to each particular phase. Each phase may have zero or more goals bound to it.
***************************************************************************************

注:executing a phase will first execute all proceeding phases in
order ending with the phase specified on the command-line. Each phases corresponds to zero or more goals, and
since we haven't performed any plugin configuration or customization, this example binds a set of standard plugin
goals to the default lifecycle.

5-Phase and goals

resources:resources

The resources goal of the Resources plugin is bound to the resources phase. This goal copies all of the
resources from src/main/resources and any other configured resource directories to the output directory.

compiler:compile
The compile goal of the Compiler plugin is bound to the compile phase. This goal compiles all of the source
code from src/main/java or any other configured source directories to the output directory.

resources:testResources
The testResources goal of the Resources plugin is bound to the test-resources phase. This goal copies all
of the resources from src/test/resources and any other configured test resource directories to a test output
directory.

compiler:testCompile
The testCompile goal of the Compiler plugin is bound to the test-compile phase. This goal compiles test
cases from src/test/java and any other configured test source directories to a test output directory.

surefire:test
The test goal of the Surefire plugin is bound to the test phase. This goal executes all of the tests and creates
output files that capture detailed results. By default this goal will terminate a build if there is a test failure.

jar:jar
The jar goal of the Jar plugin is bound to the package phase. This goal packages the output directory into a
JAR file.

mvn resources:resources \
compiler:compile \
resources:testResources \
compiler:testCompile \             ==========>   mvn package
surefire:test \
jar:jar

注:When Maven executes a goal, each goal has access to the information defined
in a project's POM. When the jar:jar goal needs to create a JAR file, it looks to the POM to find out what the Jar
file's name is. When the compiler:compile tasks compiles Java source code into bytecode, it looks to the POM to
see if there are any parameters for the compile goal. Goals execute in the context of a POM. Goals are actions we
wish to take upon a project, and a project is defined by a POM.

注:The default remote repositories can be replaced or augmented with references
to custom Maven repositories maintained by your organization. There are multiple products available to allow
organizations to manage and maintain mirrors of the public Maven repositories.

注:The standard for a Maven repository is to store an artifact in the following directory relative to the root of the repository:
/<groupId>/<artifactId>/<version>/<artifactId>-<version>.<packaging>

注:Maven resolved the coordinates of the JUnit
dependency―junit:junit:3.8.1―to a path in a Maven repository /junit/junit/3.8.1/junit-3.8.1.jar.

7-mvn site
this lifecycle is concerned solely with processing
site content under the src/site directories and generating reports. After this command executes, you should see a
project web site in the target/site directory. Load target/site/index.html and you should see a basic shell of
a project site.

注:How did we find these dependencies? Did we just "know" the appropriate groupId and artifactId values? Some
of the dependencies are so widely used (like Log4J) that you'll just remember what the groupId and artifactId
are every time you need to use them. Velocity, Dom4J, and Jaxen were all located using the helpful web site
http://www.mvnrepository.com. This site provides a search interface to the Maven repository, you can use it to
search for dependencies.

注:support for transitive dependencies. Let's say
your project depends on a library which, in turn, depends on five or ten other libraries (something like Spring or
Hibernate, for example). Instead of having to track down all of these dependencies and list them in your pom.xml
explicitly, you can simply depend on the library you are interested in and Maven will add the dependencies of this
library to your project's dependencies implicitly.Maven will also take care of working out conflicts between
dependencies, and Maven also provides you with the ability to customize the default behavior and exclude certain
transitive dependencies.

注:Note that
Maven doesn't just download the JUnit JAR file, Maven also downloads a POM file for the JUnit dependency.
The fact that Maven downloads POM files in addition to artifacts is central to Maven's support for transitive
dependencies.

注:When you install your project's artifact in the local Maven repository, you will also notice that Maven publishes a
slightly modified version of the project's pom.xml file in the same directory as the JAR file.

注:The simple project's pom.xml contains a single
dependency―junit:junit:jar:3.8.1―with a scope of test. When a dependency has a scope of test, this
means that it will not be available to the compile goal of the Compiler plugin. It will only be added to the
classpath for the compiler:testCompile and surefire:test goals.


注:The provided scope tells Maven that a dependency is needed for
compilation, but should not be bundled with the output of a build. The provided scope comes in handy when you
are developing a web application, you'll need to compile your code against the Servlet specification, but you don't
want to include the Servlet API JAR in your web application's WEB-INF/lib directory.

注:Site reports
are customized by configuring which reports are included in a build via the pom.xml file.

注:To parse the XML response from Yahoo!, we're going to be using Dom4J and Jaxen, to format the output of this command-line program we are going to be using Velocity, and we will also need to add a dependency for Log4J which we will be using for
logging.If you add these dependencies to the project's pom.xml file and
then run mvn install, you will see Maven downloading all of these dependencies and other transitive.

注:How did we find these dependencies?http://www.mvnrepository.com. This site provides a search interface to the Maven repository, you can use it to
search for dependencies.

注:the Main class configures Log4J with a classpath resource named
log4j.properties, and the WeatherFormatter references a Velocity template from the classpath named
output.vm. Both of these resources need to be in the default package (or the root of the classpath).
To add these resources, we'll need to create a new directory from the base directory of the
project―src/main/resources. Since this directory was not created by the archetype:create task, we need to
create it.

注:Using the Exec plugin from the Codehaus Mojo project we can execute this program. To execute the Main class,
execute the following command from the project's base directory.
$ mvn install
$ mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.sonatype.maven.weather.Main

注:The Exec plugin allows you to execute Java classes and other scripts. It is not a core Maven plugin, but it is
available from the Mojo project hosted by Codehaus. For a full description of the Exec plugin, run:
$ mvn help:describe -Dplugin=exec -Dfull

注:The Exec plugin made it possible for us to run this program without having to load the appropriate dependencies
into the classpath. In any other build system, we would have had to copy all of the program dependencies to some
sort of lib/ directory containing a collection of JAR files. Then, we would have had to write a simple script
which included our program's bytecode and all of our dependencies on a classpath.

8-mvn dependency:resolve -X使它显示得更多更详细
If you need to find out what is on the classpath, you can use the Maven Dependency plugin to print
out a list of resolved dependencies.

注:Apache Commons IO―the IOUtils class. IOUtils provides
a number of helpful static functions that take most of the work out of Input/Output operations. In this particular
unit test we use IOUtils.toString() to copy the format-expected.dat classpath resource to a String.

注:A test-scoped dependency is a dependency which is only available on the classpath during test compilation and
test execution. If your project has war or ear packaging, a test-scoped dependency would not be included in the
project's output archive. 
<dependency>
<groupId>org.apache.commons</groupId>
<artifactId>commons-io</artifactId>
<version>1.3.2</version>
<scope>test</scope>
</dependency>

注:测试的时候也是需要资源的比如需要一些回路的xml文件来冒充数据。src/test/resource

注:The Maven Surefire plugin has a test goal which is bound to the test phase. This test goal executes all of the
unit tests this project can find under src/test/java. In the case of this project, you can see that the Surefire
plugin's test goal executed WeatherFormatterTest and YahooParserTest. When the Maven Surefire plugin runs
the JUnit tests, it also generates XML and text reports in the ${basedir}/target/surefire-reports directory.

注:If you
have failing unit tests, and you would still like to produce build output, you are going to have to tell Maven to
ignore build failures.

10-mvn install assembly:assembly

we're going to use
the predefined jar-with-dependencies format. To configure the Maven Assembly Plugin, we need to add the
following plugin configuration to our existing build configuration in the pom.xml.
<plugins>
<plugin>
<artifactId>maven-assembly-plugin</artifactId>
<configuration>
<descriptorRefs>
<descriptorRef>jar-with-dependencies</descriptorRef>
</descriptorRefs>
</configuration>
</plugin>
</plugins>

Once our assembly is assembled in target/simple-weather-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar, we can run the
Main class again from the command line. To run the Simple Weather's Main class, execute the following
$ cd target
$ java -cp simple-weather-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar com.sonatype.maven.weather.Main 10002


注:The jar-with-dependencies format creates a single JAR file which includes all of the bytecode from the
simple-weather project and the unpacked bytecode from all of the dependencies.
dependencies. This somewhat unconventional
format produces a 9 MiB JAR file containing approximately 5290 classes, but it does provide for an easy
distribution format for applications you've developed with Maven.

注：Once you've compiled, tested, and packaged your web application, you'll likely want to deploy it to a servlet
container and test the index.jsp which was created by the Maven Archetype plugin.

给web项目配置Jetty:

12-~/examples$ mvn jetty:run

注:Maven expects the document root of the web application to be stored in src/main/webapp.

注:在给maven web项目添加完servlet后，运行mvn compile

注:To write a servlet, we'll need to add the Servlet API as a project dependency. The Servlet specification is a JAR
file that can be downloaded from Sun Microsystems at http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/download.html. Once
the JAR file is downloaded you'll need to install the resulting JAR in you local Maven repository located at
~/.m2/repository. The same process will have to be repeated for all of the J2EE APIs maintained by Sun
Microsystems―JNDI, JDBC, Servlet, JSP, JTA, and others. If this strike you as somewhat tedious, you are not
alone. Lucky for you, there is a simpler alternative to downloading all of these libraries and installing them
manually―Apache Geronimo's independent open-source implementations.

注:Now, for the purposes of your programming, there is little to
no difference between the Servlet API JAR downloaded from Sun Microsystems and the Servlet API JAR
implemented by the Apache Geronimo project, both have passed a rigorous Test Compatibility Kit (TCK) from
Sun Microsystems.

注:To add the Servlet specification API as a dependency to your project's POM,
<dependency>
<groupId>org.apache.geronimo.specs</groupId>
<artifactId>geronimo-servlet_2.4_spec</artifactId>
<version>1.1.1</version>
<scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
</dependencies>

注:SUN的JAR的协议是不可再传播，只能从SUN官方下载，现在geronimo也可以发布了。

注:If you were interested in writing a custom JSP tag for this simple web application, you would need to add a
dependency on the JSP 2.0 spec.Use the following configuration to add this dependency.

<dependency>
<groupId>org.apache.geronimo.specs</groupId>
<artifactId>geronimo-jsp_2.0_spec</artifactId>
<version>1.1</version>
<scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>

12-mvn clean install
Once you've add the Servlet specification as a dependency, run mvn clean install followed by mvn jetty:run.

These modules are defined in the modules element and each module element
corresponds to a subdirectory off of the simple-parent/ directory. Maven knows to look in these directories for
pom.xml files, and it will add submodules to the list of Maven projects included in a build.

13-mvn clean install
since
simple-webapp depends on simple-weather, the simple-weather JAR needs to be created before the
simple-webapp project can compile. To do this, you will run mvn clean install command from the
simple-parent project.

~/examples/ch06/simple-parent$ mvn clean install

[INFO] Reactor build order:

[INFO] ----------------------------------------------------------------------------


注:When Maven is executed against a project with submodules, Maven first loads the parent POM and locates all of
the submodule POMs. Maven then puts all of these project POMs into something called the Maven Reactor which
analyzes the dependencies between modules. The Reactor takes care of ordering components to ensure that
interdependent modules are compiled and installed in the proper order. Once the Reactor figures out the order in
which projects must be built, Maven then executes the specified goals for every module in a multi-module build.
In this example, you can see that Maven builds simple-weather before simple-webapp effectively executing
mvn clean install for each submodule.

注:When you specify clean, you make sure that Maven is going
to remove old output before it compiles and packages an application. Running clean isn't necessary,
but it is a useful precaution to make sure that you are performing a "clean build".

You can then start the web application with:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Every project which uses Hibernate might also have a
dependency on the Spring Framework and a MySQL JDBC driver. Instead of having to include these
dependencies in every project that uses Hibernate, Spring, and MySQL you could create a special POM that does
nothing more than declare a set of common dependencies. You could create a project called persistence-deps
(short for Persistence Dependencies), and have every project that needs to do persistence depend on this
convenience project:

<project>
<groupId>com.sonatype.maven</groupId>
<artifactId>persistence-deps</artifactId>
<version>1.0</version>
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&
<packaging>pom</packaging>
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&
<dependencies>
<dependency>
<groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>
<artifactId>hibernate</artifactId>
<version>${hibernateVersion}</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
<groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>
<artifactId>hibernate-annotations</artifactId>
<version>${hibernateAnnotationsVersion}</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
<groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
<artifactId>spring-hibernate3</artifactId>
<version>${springVersion}</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
<groupId>mysql</groupId>
<artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
<version>${mysqlVersion}</version>
</dependency>
</dependencies>
<properties>
<mysqlVersion>(5.1,)</mysqlVersion>
<springVersion>(2.0.6,)</springVersion>
<hibernateVersion>3.2.5.ga</hibernateVersion>
<hibernateAnnotationsVersion>3.3.0.ga</hibernateAnnotationsVersion>
</properties>
</project>

If you create this project in a directory named persistence-deps, all you need to do is create this pom.xml and
run mvn install. Since the packaging type is pom, this POM is installed in your local repository. You can now add
this project as a dependency and all of it's dependencies will be added to your project. When you declare a
dependency on this persistence-deps project, don't forget to specify the dependency type as pom.
Example 8.14. Declaring a Dependency on a POM
<project>
<description>This is a project requiring JDBC</description>
...
<dependencies>
...
<dependency>
<groupId>com.sonatype.maven</groupId>
<artifactId>persistence-deps</artifactId>
<version>1.0</version>
<type>pom</type>
</dependency>
</dependencies>
</project>

If you later decide to switch to a different JDBC driver, for example, JTDS, just replace the dependencies in the
persistence-deps project to use net.sourceforge.jtds:jtds instead of mysql:mysql-java-connector and
update the version number. All projects depending on persistence-deps will use JTDS if they decide to update
to the newer version.

If you need to share a large number of
dependencies between projects, you could also just establish parent-child relationship between projects and
refactor all common dependencies to the parent project, but the disadvantage to the parent-child approach is that a
project can only have one dependency. Sometimes it makes more sense to group similar dependencies together
and reference a pom dependency, this way your project can reference as many of these consolidated dependency
POMs as it needs to .

---------------------------------------------------------------

注:There is a difference between inheriting from a parent project, and being managed by an multi-module project. 

A parent project is one that passes its values to its children. 

A multi-module project simply manages a group of other sub-projects or modules. The multi-module relationship is defined from the top-most level downwards. 

When setting up a multi-module project, you are simply telling a project that its build should include the specified modules. Multi-module builds are to be used to group modules together in a single build. 

The parent/child relationship is defined from the leaf node upwards. The parent/child relationship deals more with the definition of a particular project. When you associate a child with its parent, you are telling Maven that a project's POM is
derived from another.

注:
1-the Maven project used to generate this book --->modules
2-a hypothetical project that contains a number of logically grouped modules.--->parent

we run mvn package in a multi-module project named
maven-book. This multi-module project includes two submodules: book-examples and book-chapters. Neither of
these projects share the same parent, they are related only in that they are modules in the maven-book project.
When we run the
book-examples build from book-examples/ directory with mvn package, it has no knowledge that it is a part of

submodule 是用来将多个项目打包成一个项目
parent 是多个项目有很多共同的依赖包和配置项，需要都放在父项目

Everything is a submodule for reasons of convenience, to build the entire system just go to the
big-system project directory and run mvn package.

When it makes sense to share dependencies and build configuration, a parent/child
relationship should be used. When it doesn't make sense is when there are distinct differences between two
projects. Take, for example, the server-side and client-side projects. It is possible to create a system where
client-side and server-side inherited a common POM from big-system, but as soon as a significant
divergence between the two child projects develops, you then have to figure out creative ways to factor out
common build configuration to big-system without affecting all of the children. Even though client-side and
server-side might both depend on Log4J, they also might have distinct plugin configurations.

Life Cycle

1-clean

	1.2-clean
	1.3-post-clean

mvn clean:clean 只执行1.2
mvn clean 执行1.1 1.2 1.3

The Clean plugin's clean goal (clean:clean) deletes the output of a build by deleting
the build directory. If you haven't customized the location of the build directory it will be the ${basedir}/target
directory as defined by the Super POM. 

When you execute the clean:clean goal you do not do so by executing
the goal directly with mvn clean:clean, you do so by executing the clean phase of the clean lifecycle. 
Executing the clean phase gives Maven an opportunity to execute any other goals which may be bound to the pre-clean
phase.

binds the antrun:run goal to the pre-clean phase to echo an alert that the
project artifact is about to be deleted. In this example, the antrun:run goal is being used to execute some
arbitrary Ant commands to check for an existing project artifact. If the project's artifact is about to be deleted it
will print this to the screen

Maven2插件开发

注:A Maven Plugin is a Maven artifact which contains a plugin descriptor and one or more Mojos.
A Mojo can be thought of as a goal in Maven, and every goal corresponds to a Mojo.

注:When you write your own plugin, you are simply grouping together a set of related Mojos
(or goals) in a single plugin artifact.

注:A Mojo is much more than just a goal in Maven, it is a component managed by Plexus that can include references
to other Plexus components.

注:This plugin descriptor is present in the plugin JAR file in META-INF/maven/plugin.xml. When
Maven loads a plugin, it reads this XML file, instantiates and configures plugin objects to make the Mojos
contained in a plugin available to Maven.

注:When you are writing custom Maven plugins, you will almost never need to think about writing a plugin
descriptor.The lifecycle goals bound to the maven-plugin packaging type show that the plugin:descriptor goal is bound to the generate-resources phase.

注:When Maven uses a plugin,
it will download any required dependencies before it attempts to execute a goal from this plugin.

Groups are a powerful feature of Nexus, they allow you to combine multiple repositories in a single URL. Nexus

Party, Releases, and Snapshots with the Central Maven repository. The public-snapshots repository combines the
Apache Snapshots and Codehaus Snapshots repositories.
