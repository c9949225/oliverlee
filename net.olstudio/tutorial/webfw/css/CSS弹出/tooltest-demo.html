You may use an absolute page complete with "http://", which works fine, assuming
that the served MIME-type for this .htc file is  "text/x-component". -->

			<span>Aren't these big birds cute? Ostriches can be up to 2.5 meters tall (8 ft) with a 
			mass over 155 kilograms (320 lbs), plus they can run 65 km/h (40 mph). You might not 
			want to mess with <em>these</em> babies!

	<p class="note">
	<strong>Note:</strong> To view the tooltip effect in IE/Win browsers, you will need to download 
	the <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~peterned/htc/csshover.htc"><strong>csshover.htc</strong></a> 
	file and save it in the same directory that this file is saved in.
	</p>

	<p>
	The big image to the left is <em>not a link</em>, and yet Explorer for windows 
	(IE5 and up) will still obey the <strong>:hover</strong> rules that make the popup possible,
	thanks to <strong>Peter Nederlof's</strong> wonderful Jscript. Woohoo! 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Notice how when the pointer is moved off the image the popup vanishes, but when 
	the pointer is moved off the image but remains on the popup, the popup is still 
	there. This effect will make possible a simple CSS dropdown menu later on in the 
	series. 
	</p>
	
	<h3>Opera 7 Bug</h3>
	
	<p>
	This image was originally in a div that was floated to the left, but it so happens that
	if the element that serves as the popup "parent" is also floated, then Opera 7 will
	clip any part of the popup that lies across the float's margin (if any), and beyond that 
	point it will not vanish once the popup parent is no longer hovered. Ick.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	This bug can easily be prevented by floating an outer div container, and letting 
	an inner non-floated div be the popup parent. Only when a single element is both 
	floated <em>and</em> launches a popup, will this Opera 7 bug occur.  
	</p>
	
	<h3>IE5.x/Win Bug</h3>
	
	<p>
	A problem crops up when viewing in IE5 or IE5.5 for Windows, with the result that 
	the <strong>:hover</strong> rules are ignored. This only happens when the :hover rule 
	selector does not contain the "type" of element being hovered. This means that if the 
	popup parent is a div, the selector must read:
	</p> 
	
	<p><strong>div.popup-parent:hover {styles}</strong></p>
	
	<p>
	and not just:
	</p>
	
	<p><strong>.popup-parent:hover {styles}</strong></p>
	
	<p>
	This also applies to the <strong>div.popup-parent:hover span {styles}</strong>. 
	While this is a pain, it's not a fatal flaw when the bug is understood. We don't yet know
	if it is a basic bug in the older IE browsers, or if the Jscript just needs to be improved.
	If so, this problem may go away soon.
