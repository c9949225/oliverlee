1-Each buildfile contains one 'project' 
and at least one (default) 'target'. 
Targets contain 'task' elements. 
Each task element of the buildfile can have an 'id' attribute 
and can later be referred to by the value supplied to this. 
The value has to be unique.

2-  <target name="build-module-A" if="module-A-present"/>
    <target name="build-own-fake-module-A" unless="module-A-present"/>

3-In the event you should need to include this construct literally (i.e. without property substitutions), simply "escape" the '$' character by doubling it. To continue the previous example:

  <echo>$${builddir}=${builddir}</echo>

will echo this message:

  ${builddir}=build/classes
